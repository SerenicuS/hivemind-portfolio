    <h1>Formula of Love</h1>

    <p>
        What is love?<br>
        Heard it like a million times<br>
        Seen it like every marriage that has a dove.<br>
        Might be a theft like a crime
    </p>

    <p>
        Because I have seen someone cry<br>
        As if their belongings got stolen<br>
        A thief wearing a bow tie<br>
        or a thief's cheeks that are swollen
    </p>

    <p>
        What did he stole? was it her purse?<br>
        Did she use charm to traverse,<br>
        The distance between them and you?<br>
        Without using a shoe?
    </p>

    <p>
        I am confused,<br>
        Is this love they are talking?<br>
        They steal something we cannot see?<br>
        Like a delivery guy knocking,<br>
        Yet no item to see?
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, would it be inside of me?<br>
        An intangible object to get,<br>
        Is it memory like a casette<br>
        Or a voice using headset?
    </p>

    <p>
        Really, its about abstract?<br>
        Are we dealing with math,<br>
        That I need to subtract<br>
        What I know to know love<br>
        Sadness as an aftermath?
    </p>

    <p>
        I thought it was biology?<br>
        Just men and women loving,<br>
        Like how in mythology<br>
        With giggles and blushing
    </p>

    <p>
        Love is just an excuse,<br>
        To make sense about parading,<br>
        Our intention to reproduce<br>
        In a way that makes Zues<br>
        Gets reused<br>
        for our produce,<br>
        sons who wants to seduce.
    </p>

    <p>
        It made my mind hurt,<br>
        Therefore its just a transaction?<br>
        Served in a fancy restaurant<br>
        So it doesnt sound selfish,<br>
        Hoping it will not be blurt,<br>
        Out of my mouth,<br>
        That I only want her physical-<br>
        Just a fraction-<br>
        Just to flaunt
    </p>

    <p>
        Then what is love for you?<br>
        Should I expect to cry?<br>
        Should I normalize being hurt?<br>
        Would it make sense that you are hurt,<br>
        Yet didn't got physically hurt?
    </p>

    <p>
        What are the benefits of love?<br>
        Would it be about the intangible results?<br>
        That not even logic can go above?<br>
        Should I go to God to consult?
    </p>

    <p>
        Would you accept me if I want love,<br>
        With someone who cannot think,<br>
        So if I got hurt,<br>
        It's just my fault.<br>
        Problem fades with a blink.
    </p>

    <p>
        Can love like a one season,<br>
        No fall, no winter, just summer?<br>
        Is it a valid reason?<br>
        Like a drummer,<br>
        Doing the same beat?
    </p>

    <p>
        Love cannot exist,<br>
        If it is one time<br>
        It is like a mist<br>
        It needs a rhyme<br>
        Whether the rhyme
    </p>

    <p>
        Is good and bad,<br>
        Halftime or fulltime,<br>
        Expecting it to be glad<br>
        Will never be called love
    </p>

    <p>
        Love is like a drug and a medication<br>
        Putting you in a position of prostration<br>
        While loving each seconds,<br>
        Of how vulenrable that reckons<br>
        How dumb is to love<br>
        Like a ringdove.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore is it worth the time,<br>
        And effort for its lifetime,<br>
        Of expected suffering,<br>
        Yet sometime of muttering-<br>
        Happiness?
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>G</em><br>
        Hey,
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>B</em><br>
        oh, Hi?<br>
        Sorry, I was talking to my friend.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>G</em><br>
        Uh, I constantly see you here,<br>
        And you are really beautiful,<br>
        Can I give you my contact number<br>
        I know it sounds weird speaking this to you,<br>
        If I dont talk to you this moment,<br>
        My love for you will never land on someone like you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Love cannot be dissected like a fish,<br>
        It can only be shown using experience<br>
        But love can be served as a dish<br>
        To those who are not unexperienced
    </p>

    <p>
        So love recklessly. But wisely.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 50px; color: #d4d4d4; font-style: italic;">
        "Love is an equation where suffering is the constant, but two souls can compound joy faster than pain accrues interest."
