    <h1>The Garden</h1>

    <p>
        We are forced to live without our opinion,<br>
        Suffered and harmed by our situation.<br>
        We did not choose this, yet we are being punished,<br>
        Trying to understand why we wished.<br>
        Can I just die and forget about all of this existence?<br>
        So you can sleep peacefully, with innocence.
    </p>

    <p>
        You found the garden is barren, when you arrived in this world.<br>
        Perhaps you could plant flowers,<br>
        Like the stories that parents read to their children,<br>
        Creating warm memories that last a while.
    </p>

    <p>
        You died without seeing your garden bloom,<br>
        Flowers flourishing, with boons.<br>
        Your son found the same garden, with the same burden,<br>
        Asking questions of your garden, which you viewed as treasure.<br>
        Why does the garden look ordinary?
    </p>

    <p>
        They do not start from scratch.<br>
        The garden was shaped by your mother.<br>
        The flowers were planted by you, his father.<br>
        Why do we cling to older traditions, thinking the garden should stay barren?<br>
        Instead of planting something that our children can thrive upon?
    </p>

    <p style="color: #d4d4d4; font-style: italic;">
        Let us try to make the world greener,<br>
        And fulfill the hope we wished to see.
    </p>
